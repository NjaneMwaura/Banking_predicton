Portuguese Bank Revenue Improvement Project
Overview
This project aims to address the revenue decline faced by a Portuguese bank due to a lack of investment in long-term deposits. The bank seeks to identify existing customers with a higher likelihood of subscribing to long-term deposits and focus its marketing efforts on these targeted customers. This will help the bank improve its long-term deposit subscriptions and boost revenue.

Model
The project uses a ensemble methods (GBoost) to handle the task. The model’s performance is shown in the classification report below, where 0 represents customers who are not likely to subscribe and 1 represents customers who are likely to subscribe to long-term deposits.

Conclusion


This project demonstrates the potential of using machine learning techniques to improve the bank’s long-term deposit subscriptions and boost revenue by targeting existing customers with a higher likelihood of subscribing.
